# Java Data Structures
After several of my university assignments required me to implement my own data structures, I've decided to create a repository of all the structures I think 
I'll be using in the future. That way I won't have to waste time creating and debugging the same code again and again, and can focus on specializing the data structure 
to what I need.

## Basic Structures
- ArrayList :heavy_check_mark:
- Singly Linked List :heavy_check_mark:
- Doubly Linked List :heavy_check_mark:
- Stack :heavy_check_mark:
- BoundedStack :heavy_check_mark:
- Queue :heavy_check_mark:
- BoundedQueue :x:

## Trees
- Array Based Binary Tree :x:
- Node Based Binary Tree :heavy_check_mark:
- Binary Search Tree :x:
- AVL Tree :x:
	
## Priority Queues
- Sorted Priority Queue :heavy_check_mark:
- Unsorted Priority Queue :heavy_check_mark:
- Heap :heavy_check_mark:

## Maps
- Unsorted Map :heavy_check_mark:
- Sorted Map :heavy_check_mark:
- Hash Map :heavy_check_mark:

## Graphs
- Edge List Graph :x:
- Adjacency List Graph :x:
- Adjacency Map Graph :x:
- Adjacency Matrix Graph :x:
