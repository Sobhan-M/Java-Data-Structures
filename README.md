# Java Data Structures
After several of my university assignments required me to implement my own data structures, I've decided to create a repository of all the structures I think 
I'll be using in the future. That way I won't have to waste time creating and debugging the same code again and again, and can focus on specializing the data structure 
to what I need.

## Basic Structures
- ArrayList :heavy_check_mark:
- Singly Linked List :x:
- Doubly Linked List :heavy_check_mark:
- Stack :x:
- Queue :x:
- Array Based Binary Tree :x:
- Node Based Binary Tree :x:
	
	
## Key-Value Structures
- Priority Queue :x:
- Heap :x:
- Unsorted Map :x:
- Hash Table :x:
- Dictionary :x:
- Binary Search Tree :x:
- AVL Tree :x:
